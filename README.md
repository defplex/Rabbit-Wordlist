# Rabbit-Wordlist
Wordlist compiled from Stealer Logs

There are just over 6 million passwords in this Wordlist compiled from publically available Stealer Logs (no paid-for data was used!)

The Wordlist has been split into 4 files to work around Github's file upload size limitation. A quick way to join them together from the terminal is to move all 4 files into their own directory and then run:
cat * > Rabbit-Wordlist-Deduped.txt

There is no discernable order of the passwords and they are clustered together per user hence you will come across groups of very similar passwords just with slight variations. The Wordlist has been pruned as best as we could but there could still be "dirty" entries in the Wordlist so remove them as you see fit.
